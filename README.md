# Run the World (code) üï≥

This repository contains the source code for the Cycling '74 Max + RNBO code, along with exports, for the sound engine in the Interplanetary Players.

## Prerequisites

In order to run the code, you will need to have the following software installed:

1. Max: Max is a visual programming language for music and multimedia developed by Cycling '74. You can download Max from their official website here.
1. RNBO: RNBO is a required external library for Max, which provides additional functionality. You can download and install RNBO from here.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. 
1. Open Max on your computer.
1. Import the code files from the cloned repository into your Max project.
1. Make sure that RNBO is properly installed and available in your Max environment.
1. Run the Max patch containing the code you wish to execute.

## Usage

Once you have successfully set up the code, you can use it as per your requirements. The specific instructions for using the code are beyond the scope of this README file and should be documented separately.

# Interplanetary Players - Web ü™ê

An initiative that explores the intersection of digital and physical worlds through the design of intelligent music players and meta-musical instruments. 
Concibed as a global network of intelligent music tools that use algorithmic approaches to facilitate music listening and creation, allowing users to take control of their sound in new and exciting ways. These tools are designed to be accessible to anyone, regardless of musical training or technical knowledge, and aim to reactivate auditory consciousness and push the boundaries of what's possible in musical creation and exploration. 

This players are used with the ENT Cards, a new paradigm for Music Distribution. It draws inspiration from a range of sources, including, digital lutherie, history, scientific discoveries, worldbuilding, visual arts, and sound creation, to create a unique and immersive experience for users.

# Reactivating Auditory Consciousness üëÇüèΩ

At the heart of our approach is the idea that music can be a collaborative and immersive experience. That‚Äôs why we are developing a range of tools that allow users to create and remix music in new and unconventional ways. Using different algorithmic approaches, we are creating intelligent music players that will be able to understand and respond to the user‚Äôs creative input, even if they‚Äôve never had any musical training.

We aim to reactivate auditory consciousness, allowing people to explore new dimensions of music and sound that they may not have even known existed. With the help of meta-musical instruments, users can play music, soundscapes, and spoken voice that are truly unique, combining analog and digital technologies to push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible.

By connecting people around the world through the power of music and technology, we believe that we can create a new era of music that is more engaging, exciting, and inclusive than ever before. Imagine a world where people from all over the globe can connect and collaborate on new musical projects, breaking down barriers and building new communities through the power of sound.

Website, www.collect.maar.world, offers demos and the option to subscribe to a newsletter. The project encourages collaboration and experimentation and can be used in various settings, such as live performances, studio recordings, and interactive installations.

## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank Cycling '74 for their Max programming language and the developers of RNBO for their valuable contribution.

Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or concerns.

Happy coding!

Based on p5.js and RNBO. üöÇ üåà ü™ê

p5.js is a JavaScript library that provides a set of tools for creating interactive graphics, animations, and sound in web browsers. It is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, making it a popular choice for beginners and experts alike. With p5.js, developers can create complex visual and audio experiences using simple and intuitive syntax.

RNBO is a library and toolchain for building and exporting software that incorporates the sound of Max, a popular visual programming language for music and multimedia. With RNBO, users can create a wide range of music-related projects, from web experiences and hardware music devices to audio plugins and new Max objects, all from the same patch. Additionally, RNBO offers an intuitive, user-friendly interface for patching and experimenting with code, making it accessible to a wide range of users. Overall, RNBO represents an exciting new tool for musicians and programmers alike, offering a powerful and versatile platform for music creation and experimentation.
